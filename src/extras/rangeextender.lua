--This program is aimed to provide an in-box way to put a multidoor anywhere in the world and have it work with the server (as long as its chunkloaded)
--What this means is, instead of putting a modem in the door computer, you put the linked card in the doorcomputer and the other in a computer running this.
--This computer must have a modem (wired recommended plugged into a relay plugged into the server) and at least 1 linking card with no maximum.
