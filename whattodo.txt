Instructions on what I gotta check out and maybe add

Definitely Servertine (this):
1. Save changes done on DoorSetup to prevent data loss upon leaving the module
2. DoorSetup allow runtime door editing on currently running doors. (maybe an added perk of choosing door systems through naming multidoors)
5. SectorControl module for Servertine (an optional manual changing utility)
7. Possible KeyPad, RFID Reader, and Biometric Reader.
8. Database remote control module
9. Make SectorControl utilize runtime changes (3 wires per sector: 1 to turn off lockdown, another to enable, and another to lock open)
